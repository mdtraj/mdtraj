v1.0.0 (September 7, 2014)
--------------------------
We're pleased to announce the 1.0 release of MDTraj! Our 1.0 release indicates
that MDTraj is stable enough to be used in production calculations, and that
we have a stronger commitment to backward compatibility. Two substantial new
features have been added since 0.9, but the API has remained quite stable.

  feature is quite new and will continue to evolve throughout the 1.X release
  cycle.
- New ``md.compute_dssp`` function for DSSP secondary structure assignment.
- Multiple bugfixes in PDB parsing, including handling of ATOM serial's
  CONNECT records, support of .gziped files,
- Fix compilation errors on OSX and older linux platforms (gcc-4.1)
- ``compute_distances``, ``compute_angles``, ``compute_dihedrals`` now accept
  iterators for the indices argument.
- New ``Topology.select_atom_indices`` method.
- Ability to save b factors in PDB files.
- ``restrict_atoms`` has been deprecated, and replaced with ``atom_slice``.
- Better support for multi-chain proteins in dihedral methods.

v0.9.0 (June 10, 2014)
----------------------
- Brand new ``nmr`` library that includes transparent python interfaces to
  SHIFTX2, PPM and SPARTA+ for chemical shifts, as a library for scalar
  couplings (J) using the Karplus relation.
- New ``lprmsd`` distance metric for linear-programming root mean square
  deviations which optimizes over the label correspondence between
  exchangeable atoms in the two conformations.
- New ``wernet_nilsson`` function for hydrogen bond identification.
- New parser for ``mol2`` format files.
- Many new convenience methods on ``md.Topology``, including ``to_bondgraph``
  to create a NetworkX graph from a topology.
- New ``compute_drid`` function for calculation of distribution of
  reciprocal inter-atomic distances (DRID) distance metric
- Core geometry routines ``compute_angles`` and ``compute_dihedrals`` now
  respect periodic boundary conditions via a substantial internal refactoring
  of the geometry library. They also have significantly improved numerical
  stability.
- Numerous bugfixes, including fixing potential segfaults with ``md.rmsd`` and
  the NetCDF parser as well as increased compliance for AMBER .prmtop and
  TINKER .arc parsers.
- Many internal changes to hardware detection code, ensuring that compiled
  binaries run appropriately on any platform, including those that don't support
  modern CPU features like SSE4.
- Major improvements to our automated testing framework. Every pull request
  and commit to MDTraj is now being tested across a matrix of 4 different
  python versions on linux as well as python3 on Windows.
- A number of brand new example IPython notebooks on the website demonstrating
  all of these new features!


v0.8.0 (March 10, 2014)
-----------------------
- New parser for AMBER PRMTOP topology files.
- Removed dependency on netCDF4 and the c libnetcdf. We're now exclusively using
  the pure python NetCDF3 implementation in ``scipy.io``, which is now a dependency.
- Removed dependency on ``simtk.unit`` as an external package
- Fixed a behavior where "default" unit cell dimensions were being saved in
  trajectories without periodic boundary conditions in XTC, DCD and TRR, which
  when loaded up later were interpreted as being "real" periodic boundary conditions.
- Better ResSeq preservation in HDF5 files.
- More detailed ``repr`` and ``str`` on ``Trajectory``.
- Load pdb files directly from a URL.
- Unicode fixes for python3.
- Bugfixes in OpenMM reporters
- New theme for the documentation with IPython notebooks for the examples
- Improvements to ``DCD seek()``
- Reorganized the internal layout of the code for easier navigation, IPython
  tab completion.
