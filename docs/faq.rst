Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1. Why am I seeing an error message about my CPU and SSE 4.1?::

     RuntimeError: This CPU does not support the required instruction set (SSE4.1)

   Some functions in MDTraj require specific CPU features (and compiler support
   for them) to enable faster performance.

   Let me guess -- you're using a Linux cluster running CentOS 5? Your system
   compiler is gcc 4.1?

   It's likely your machine actually DOES support SSE4.1 instructions, but your
   compiler is too old (e.g. gcc 4.1, released over 8 years ago) to emit them.
   Try installing MDTraj from the prebuilt :ref:`conda <install-with-conda>`
   packages, or getting a more modern compiler. (When building MDTraj from
   source, you can set the ``CC`` environment variable to point to a different
   compiler.)

   .. note::

   For Pande lab members on ``vsp-compute``, set the environment variable
   ``CC`` to ``gcc44``, and then recompile from source ::

       $ cd path-to-mdtraj/
       $ export CC=gcc44
       $ python setup.py install
