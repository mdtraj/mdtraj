Getting started
###############

Installing MDTraj
=================

MDTraj is tested (and passes) on python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3. The
developers generally use python2.7, on both mac and linux platforms. Automated
tests on linux are performed on every incremental update to the code, and release
tests are performed on mac, linux and windows.

Easy Way
--------

Just run ::

  pip install mdtraj
  
Or, if you want the bleeding-edge source code, use ::

  pip install git+git://github.com/rmcgibbo/mdtraj.git

On windows, you'll probably want to use the prebuilt binary packages
hosted on pypi.

Medium Way
----------
Clone the source code repository from github::

  $ git clone git://github.com/rmcgibbo/mdtraj.git

If you don't have ``git``, you can download the source code as a zip file from
https://github.com/rmcgibbo/mdtraj/archive/master.zip. Then, in the directory containing the source code, you can install it with. ::

  $ python setup.py install

Running the tests
=================
Running the tests is a great way to verify that everything is working. The test
suite uses `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_, which you can pick
up via ``pip`` if you don't already have it. ::

  pip install nose
  
Then, to run the tests, open a python shell and do ::

  >>> import mdtraj
  >>> mdtraj.test()

From the source directory, you can also run the tests with ``nosetests`` on
the command line

Dependencies
============

MDTraj requires a few external libraries to work properly. Some of them are
optional. You'll definitely need ``numpy``. You'll also need a working C
compiler and build environment, to compile the C-level extensions that connect
the python code to the bit-twiddling C libraries that read and  write most of
these binary formats.

Easy Way
--------

The easiest way to get all of the dependencies is to install one of the 
pre-packaged scientific python distributes like `Enthought's Canopy 
<https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_ or `Continuum's Anaconda 
<https://store.continuum.io/>`_. These distributions already contain all of 
the dependences, and are distributed via 1-click installers for Windows, Mac 
and Linux. You won't have to install anything except mdtraj, which can be done, as shown above, with ::

  pip install mdtraj

Medium Way
----------

Linux
++++++
If you're on ubuntu and have root, you can install everything through your package manager. ::

  $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev python-dev python-numpy python-nose python-setuptools cython python-numexpr python-tables netcdf-bin libnetcdf-dev python-netcdf python-networkx python-netcdf

Mac
+++
If you're on mac and want a package manager, you should be using `homebrew <http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/>`_ and ``brews``'s python (see `this page <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python>`_ for details). The best way to install numpy and scipy with ``brew`` is to use
samueljohn's tap. ::

  $ brew tap samueljohn/python
  $ brew install python
  $ brew install numpy
  $ brew install scipy
  $ brew install hdf5
  $ brew install netcdf

Then, you can install the remaining packages with pip. ::

  $ pip install nose numexpr cython tables
  $ pip install netcdf4

Harder Way : Compiling from source (no root needed)
---------------------------------------------------

If you don't already have a python installation you want to use, you can compile a new one. ::

  $ wget http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tgz
  $ tar -xzvf Python-2.7.5.tgz
  $ cd Python-2.7.5
  $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/python
  $ make
  $ make install

  $ export PATH=$HOME/local/python/bin:$PATH

To compile the dependences from source, you need to get ``libhdf5``, ``libnetcdf``, and ``numpy``, which can have some BLAS issues. I recommend configuring everything with ``--prefix`` so that you don't get your packages mixed up with system packages. NetCDF4 depends on hdf5, so you need to install HDF5 first. ::

  $ wget http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.8.11.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzvf hdf5-1.8.11.tar.gz
  $ cd hdf5-1.8.11
  $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.11
  $ make
  $ make install

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.11/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ export PATH=$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.11/bin:$PATH

  $ cd ..
  $ wget http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netcdf-4.3.0.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzvf netcdf-4.3.0.tar.gz
  $ cd netcdf-4.3.0
  $ CFLAGS="-I$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.11/include -L$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.11/lib"
  $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/netcdf-4.3.0
  $ make
  $ make install

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/opt/netcdf-4.3.0/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ export PATH=$HOME/opt/netcdf-4.3.0/bin:$PATH

You'll probably want to add those ``export`` statements to your bashrc too.

If you don't have ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` yet, you can get them with ::

  $ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzvf setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
  $ cd setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
  $ python setup.py install
  $ easy_install pip

Now you're home free ::

  $ pip install numpy
  $ pip install scipy
  $ pip install cython
  $ pip install numexpr
  $ pip install tables
  $ pip install netcdf4
  $ pip install nose
