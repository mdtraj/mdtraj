MDTraj Examples
====================

This page provides a series of examples, tutorials and recipes to help you get
started with ``mdtraj``.

Each subsection is a notebook.  To open these notebooks in a "live" IPython session
and execute the documentation interactively, you need to download the repository
and start the IPython notebook.

If you installed `MDTraj` from source, you will need to navigate to
:code:`path-to-mdtraj/examples`. The notebook files for these examples and the notebooks are available in the top level  `examples folder <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/mdtraj/tree/master/examples>`_ on github too. In the directory with the notebook
files, start an IPython notebook server:

.. code:: bash

   $ ipython notebook

.. warning:: The pre-filled out notebooks are *far* less fun than running them
             yourself!

.. toctree::

Let us know if you would like to contribute other example notebooks, or have
any suggestions for how these can be improved.
