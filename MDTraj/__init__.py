"""The mdtraj package contains tools for loading and saving molecular dynamics
trajectories in a variety of formats, including Gromacs XTC & TRR, CHARMM/NAMD
DCD, AMBER BINPOS, PDB, and HDF5.

Examples
--------
>>> from mdtraj import trajectory                             # doctest: +SKIP
>>> t = trajectory.load('traj.dcd', topology='structure.pdb') # doctest: +SKIP
>>> t.save('traj.binpos')                                     # doctest: +SKIP

Modules
-------
- trajectory
    This is the core module, with high level interfaces to all of the loading
    and saving, as well as the central Trajectory object.
- topology
    An object oriented molecular topology.
- io
    Convenience interface to the (pytables) HDF5 library
- pdb
    PDB interface
- binpos
    Low level BINPOS interface
- dcd
    Low level DCD interface
- xtc
    Low level XTC/TRR interface
