Read, write and analyze MD trajectories with only a few lines of Python code.

With MDTraj, you can

- Read and write from **every MD format imaginable** (`pdb`, `xtc`, `trr`, `dcd`, `netcdf`, `mdcrd`, `prmtop`, `gsd`, ...)
- Run **blazingly** fast RMSD calculations (4x the speed of the original Theobald QCP).
- Use tons of analysis functions like bonds/angles/dihedrals, hydrogen bonding identification, secondary structure assignment, NMR observables.
- Use a **lightweight API**, with a focus on **speed** and vectorized operations.

For details, see the [documentation](https://mdtraj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To get involved,
