This library supports the reading and writing of molecular dynamics trajectories in a variety of formats. Currently, there is full support for [PDB](http://deposit.rcsb.org/adit/docs/pdb_atom_format.html), [DCD](https://www-s.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/dcdplugin.html),
[XTC](http://manual.gromacs.org/online/xtc.html), [TRR](http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/File_Formats/.trr_File),
[binpos](https://www-s.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/binposplugin.html), [AMBER NetCDF](http://ambermd.org/netcdf/nctraj.html),
[AMBER mdcrd](http://ambermd.org/formats.html), and [MDTraj HDF5](https://github.com/rmcgibbo/mdtraj/wiki/HDF5-Trajectory-Format).
There is partial support for the TINKER arc format (only reading).
