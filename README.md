Read, write and analyze MD trajectories with only a few lines of Python code.

With MDTraj, you can

- Read and write from every MD format imaginable (pdb, xtc, trr, dcd, binpos, netcff, mdcrd, prmtop, ...)
- Run blazingly fast RMSD calculations (4x the speed of the original Theobald QCP).
- Use tons of analysis functions like bonds/angles/dihedrals, hydrogen bonding identification, secondary structure assignment, NMR observables.
- Use lightweight API, with a focus on speed and vectorized operations.

For details, see the website at [mdtraj.org](http://mdtraj.org). To get involed, take a look at the github issue tracker and/or the user forums [discourse.mdtraj.org](http://discourse.mdtraj.org).
