Read, write and analyze MD trajectories with only a few lines of Python code.

With MDTraj, you can

- Read and write from **every MD format imaginable** (`pdb`, `xtc`, `trr`, `dcd`, `binpos`, `netcdf`, `mdcrd`, `prmtop`, `gsd`, ...)
- Run **blazingly** fast RMSD calculations (4x the speed of the original Theobald QCP).
- Use tons of analysis functions like bonds/angles/dihedrals, hydrogen bonding identification, secondary structure assignment, NMR observables.
- Use a **lightweight API**, with a focus on **speed** and vectorized operations.

For details, see the website at [mdtraj.org](http://mdtraj.org). To get involved,
take a look at the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/issues)
and/or the user forums [discourse.mdtraj.org](http://discourse.mdtraj.org).

#### Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to `mdtraj` you're most welcome! Itâ€™s people like you who make it such a great tool. Generally, the library is mostly in "maintenance mode" -- we are not specifically planning to add major new features. Bug-fixes, additional testing and documentation, and small features that integrate well with the existing library are most appreciated!
