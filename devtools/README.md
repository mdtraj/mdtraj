How to release
===================

Pre-release + Github
--------------------
- Update the `docs/whatsnew.rst` document. Use [this tool](https://github.com/rmcgibbo/gh-util),
  which should list all of the PRs that have been merged since the laster release.
- Update the version number in `setup.py`, change `ISRELEASED` to `True`
- Update the version number in `devtools/conda-recipe/meta.yaml`
- Update the date in `docs/whatsnew.rst` and add a blurb about the release.
- Commit to master, and [tag](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj/releases) the
  release on github.

PyPI
----
The next step is to add the release to the python package index.

- Run `git clean -fdx` to clean the source directory.
- Create the cannoncal "sdist" (source distribution) using `python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip`. **Make sure you ran `git clean` first**
- Inspect the sdist files (they're placed in `dist/`), and make sure they look right.
  You can try installing them into your environment with pip, unzipping or untaring them, etc.
- Once you're satisfied that the sdist is correct, push the source to PyPI using
  `twine upload [path to sdist files]`. This requires being registered on PyPI as a owner or maintainer
  of the project.

Immediately after creating the sdist
------------------------------------
- Update the version number in `setup.py` to `1.(x+1).0.dev0` per PEP440;
  change `ISRELEASED` to `False`.
- Update the version number in `devtools/conda-recipe/meta.yaml` similarly.
- Add a new section in `docs/whatsnew.rst` and mark it "(Development)".
- Commit to master.

It's important that the version which is tagged on github for the release be
the (only) one with the ISRELEASED flag in setup.py set to true.

Conda
-----
- File a PR against [omnia-md/conda-recipes](https://github.com/omnia-md/conda-recipes) that
  updates the recipe's version string and source URL to pull the new sdist from PyPI. Travis
  and Appveyor will then build binary conda packages.

Wheels
------
PyPI hosts *wheels*, pre-compiled binary packages, like conda packages, for OS X and
Windows. (At the time of this writing, they are still ironing out issues w.r.t.
linux.) To create and upload wheels, download the sdist and unpack the (or check out
the exact tag from git), and run `python setup.py bdist_wheel`.

For example, to build wheels for Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5 on OS X, I ran
```
conda env remove -y -n _build
versions=("2.7" "3.4" "3.5")
for v in "${versions[@]}"; do
    conda create -y -n _build python=$v numpy cython
    source activate _build
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    source deactivate
    conda env remove -y -n _build
done
```
Then, if these all look good, you can upload them to PyPI with twine, as was done with the
sdist.


Docs Building & Hosting
=======================

After a travis build succeeds, the docs are built with sphinx and pushed to
the mdtraj.org amazon s3 account. The credentials for that account are stored,
encrypted, in the .travis.yml file.
(http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#Secure-environment-variables)

As of version 0.7-dev (0.8 release) multiple versions of the docs are hosted
online. When a build happens on a version with ISRELEASED==False, it's put into
the "latest" folder on the S3 bucket. If ISRELEASED==True, it's put into a
subfolder with the name of the short release. The relevant logic is in
`tools/travis-ci/push-docs-to-s3.py`.

In order for the select bar at the bottom of the docs that toggles between
versions to work, these folders MUST match up with the tag names on github.
This is because the list of items to put in that little dropdown menu is
dynamically determined from the github API in the browser. This is the only
way I could think of to make sure the old docs have a link to the latest
version. The logic that populates the version dropdown menu in the browser is in

`docs/themes/sphinx_rtd_theme-0.1.5/sphinx_rtd_theme/versions.html`

Specifically note that it goes to https://api.github.com/repos/mdtraj/mdtraj/releases,
and uses the `tag_names` to build the links. So these must line up with the
prefix of `mdtraj.version.short_version` used in `tools/travis-ci/push-docs-to-s3.py`
for the links not to break.
