Hi there!

MDTraj is a project that I (@rmcgibbo) primarily developed between 2013 and 2016 while I was a
graduate student. That was a long time ago! I've moved on, and no longer use MDTraj in my
current role. Most of the other contributors from that time have similarly moved on. I do
respond to github issues and pull requests from time to time, but my bandwidth is limited so
don't expect to necessarily get a response on github issues from me. (Also **please** don't
email me with support requests).

MDTraj is looking for new maintainers! I would be happy to transfer ownership and responsibility
of the code base to another group of maintainers. Please reach out to me if you're interested in
taking over the project.

Best,
Robert T. McGibbon (@rmcgibbo)
